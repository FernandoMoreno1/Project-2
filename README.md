# Project-2: Upscale Delivery

## Description
Upscale Delivery help you order from your local restaurants from wherever you are.
How it works: you sign up and we give you a list of restaurants near you.
When you find what youre looking for, you can just press "add to cart" and begin your order.

## User story
As a customer, I WANT to see the variety restaurant and food options and be able to checkout the items I picked. 
As a restaurant owner, I WANT to know what customers ordered in my restaurant and which foods need to be prepared.
